Contributing Guidelines
--------------------------

We very warmly welcome contributions.
This library has come a long way since its one-file humble beginning. On a Saturday afternoon with some buddies.
But while miuch has been done already there is still much much much more to do! Which is exciting!
If you're a developer that has an idea, suggestion or just wants to be helpful because you're nice.
See our *newly minted* :ref:`Development page <development_page>` for contribution ideas, guidelines, procedures and what to expect with your PR.
Happy developing! We hope to see your PRs soon.
